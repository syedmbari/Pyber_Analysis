# Pyber_Analysis

## **Overview of the Analysis :**

Using our *Python* skills and knowledge of *Pandas*, we created a summary ***DataFrame*** of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using *Pandas* and *Matplotlib*, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we were able to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at **PyBer**.


## Results: 

The Results we recieved from our project would be displayed in the follwoing :
- rural cities had the highest average fare per driver and ride while the urban cities had the lowest and the high fares observed in the rural cities was due to the   low number of total rides and total drivers in those cities.
- From the multiple line graph we see, the urban cities had the highest total fare within the months of January to April 2019 followed by the rural cities while the   urban cities had the lowest fare and the low fares can be attributed to the empty cells observed in the rural cities column after arranging the data into the       specified date range using the loc function.

## Summary :

The following would my summary and recomendation -
- In addition to the above analysis, I would recommend obtaining more information about the demographics of those living the the three city types and additional   two to five previous year city and ride data.
- With information such as population and age range, we can group the fares by age and city type or by population and city type.
- Also, using the loc function on two to five previous year data might better explain why the rural and suburban cities had low fares within the month of January   to April.
